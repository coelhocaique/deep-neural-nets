-- strategy 1 :
 - the normalized returns are the input and the labels say whether or not the next value
 - outperforms the last value
 - if next return value underperforms last value it doesn't mean exactly that the share is going down
 - depending on your current return you can keep trading up
 - 74 % accuracy

-- strategy 2 :
 - the normalized returns are the input and the labels say whether the next return will
 - be positive or negative
 - the idea was to combine this with strategy 1, but got just
 - 54 % accuracy

-- strategy 3 :
 - the normalized data is the input and the labels say whether the share is going up or down
 - 55 % accuracy not good

-- strategy 4 :
 - the normalized data is the input and the labels say whether the next normalized value
 - is greater or not than the last value
 -- 55 % accuracy

 -- strategy 5 :
  - data not normalized as input and the labels say whether the next value
  - is greater or not than the last value

-- strategy 6 :
   - the returns are the input and the labels say whether the next return will
   - be positive or negative

-- strategy 7 :
    - inputs are -1 and 1 and the labels say whether the next return will
    - be positive or negative
    - the idea was to combine this with strategy 1, but got just
